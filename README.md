## Features (WIP)

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Allows users to trigger and manage CI/CD pipeline execution.
- **Pipeline Configuration Support**: Define pipeline stages, jobs, and dependencies using GitLab CI/CD YAML syntax.
- **Git Integration**: Handles fetching repositories and metadata via GitPython.
- **Real-Time Log Streaming** (optional): Stream execution logs via Redis.
- **Extensible and Easy to Use**: Python's simplicity for fast prototyping and development.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### Build Instructions

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CS6510-SEA-F24/t3-cicd-cli.git
```

Build the Project:
Using Nox for Automated Builds, Tests, and Linting, file in `noxfile.py`:

We use nox to run automated sessions like testing, linting, and building the project.
Nox allows us to define a "do-all" type script to ensure everything runs in one command.

To run all sessions:

```bash
nox -s all
```

Install the dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

Build the Project: Build source distribution and wheel files:

```bash
poetry build
```

Run CLI command with Poetry:

```bash
poetry run <command>
# e.g. poetry run cicd config show
```

Running Tests
To run all unit tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

To run tests with coverage reports:

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=src/ --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80
```

Coverage reports can be found in the htmlcov/ directory.
If test coverage is below 80%, the build will fail.

Other Useful Commands:
Auto-format Code(Black): Automatically format the code in src/ and tests/ to follow PEP8 guidelines:

```bash
poetry run black src/ tests
```

Lint Code (Flake8): Check code style against PEP8 guidelines:

```bash
poetry run flake8 src/ tests/
```

## User Manual

### CLI Configuration

#### `cicd_config.json`

To simplify CLI commands and reduce the need of manually typing parameters when using
the CLI, some of the key configurations are stored in the user's local file system (default
path is `~/.cicd_config.json`) as a JSON file:

```bash
{
    "is-repo-remote": false,     # If the repo is a remote repo - default is false
    "is-run-remote": false,      # If the pipeline should run remotely - default is false
    "repo": null,                # URL to remote repo/ path to local repo - default is null
    "remote-branch": "main",     # Branch of the remote repo - default is main
    "server": null,              # Endpoint for the remote CI/CD server - default is null
    "format": "plain"            # Output format: plain/ json/ yaml - default is plain
}
```

#### CLI configuration commands

You can update, reset, or view the current configurations using the following command:

```bash
cicd config -help
```

This will show all available commands and options for managing your CLI configuration.

### Run Pipeline

#### Handling remote/ local repo

To run the CI/CD pipeline, you need to specify whether to use a remote Git repository or a local repository in the [CLI Configuration](#cli-configuration).

- **Remote Repository**: If you're using a remote Git repository, the CI/CD will run using the `main` branch by default. You can override this and specify a different branch in the [CLI Configuration](#cli-configuration).

- **Local Repository**: If you're using a local repository that is tracked by Git, you must commit all changes before running the CI/CD. The system will not allow the pipeline to run with uncommitted changes.

Ensure that your configuration is set up correctly before running the pipeline.

## Pull Request Process

### Creating a PR

#### Always use feature branch to make change:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name> # create a new branch with <branch_name>
```

> Direct push to the `main` branch is strictly forbidden as this is the Production branch. All change
> should be merged with an approved PR.

#### Ensure your code is up-to-date with the `main` branch:

```bash
git config pull.rebase true # always use rebase to reconcile divergent branches
git pull
```

> Regularly pull from the `main` branch avoids conflicts pilling up.
> Please make sure you pull again before creating a PR.

#### Follow the PR Template:

- Your PR description should address any relevant context to help the reviewer to understand the
  PR. If this is related to an issue, reference the issue in the description.
- Make sure to use the checklist, and give explanations to any unchecked ones.

#### Check PR details:

- Make sure the origin and destination of the PR is correct, as well as everything in the Commits
  and Files changed tabs before clicking "Create Pull Request".

#### Submit your PR:

- No need to manually select reviewers. Once the PR is created, 2 reviewers will be automatically
  assigned based on the [Reviewer Lottery](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/reviewer-lottery)
  process.

### Rules for PRs

#### PR Size Limit:

- PRs should not exceed 150 lines unless absolutely necessary.

  > To override this, add an `override-size-limit` label in the PR, and provide explanation in the
  > PR description.

#### Testing:

- Ensure all new code is properly tested.

#### Commit Guidelines:

- Use [meaningful commit messages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/).
  Squash commits if necessary to clean up the history.

#### Merging:

- When merging PRs, always use **SQUASH AND MERGE** to combine all changes into a single commit.

#### Review Timebox:

- Please post reviews within 24 hours after you received the review request, or ask for others to
  do the review.

## CI/CD Workflows

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation. The configured CI/CD workflows are:

- **PR Size Check**:

  - This workflow is triggered when a new PR is created, or when a new commit is pushed to an existing PR.
  - It fails if the size of PR is greater than 150 lines, and no override label is provided.

- **Assign Reviewers**:

  - This workflow is triggered when a new PR is created.
  - It assigns 2 random reviewers to the PR. Subsequent updates to the PR won't add more reviewers.

- **Pipeline Run**:
  - This workflow is triggered when:
    - A PR is created/ updated.
    - A PR is merged.
  - This workflow will execute:
    - Build: Ensures the code builds successfully.
    - Run Unit Tests: All tests must pass.
    - Test Coverage Verification: Verifies that test coverage meets minimum requirements.
    - Code Quality Checks: Checkstyle and SpotBugs
    - Artifacts Upload: Build artifacts and generated reports are uploaded after pipeline run
